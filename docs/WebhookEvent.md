Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**action** | **String** | The type of action taken that triggered the event. |  [optional]
**createdAt** | [**OffsetDateTime**](OffsetDateTime.md) | The timestamp when the event occurred. |  [optional]
**parent** | **String** | For added/removed events, the parent gid that resource was added to or removed from. The parent will be &#x60;null&#x60; for other event types. |  [optional]
**resource** | **String** | The resource gid the event occurred on.  *Note: The resource that triggered the event may be different from the one that the events were requested for. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.* |  [optional]
**type** | **String** | The type of the resource that generated the event.  *Note: Currently, only tasks, projects and stories generate events.* |  [optional]
**user** | **String** | The gid of the user who triggered the event.  *Note: The event may be triggered by a different user than the subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B modified it, the eventâ€™s user will be user B. Note: Some events are generated by the system, and will have &#x60;null&#x60; as the user. API consumers should make sure to handle this case.* |  [optional]
