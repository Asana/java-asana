# **createAttachmentForObject**
> InlineResponse200 createAttachmentForObject(resourceSubtype, file, parent, url, name, optPretty, optFields)

Upload an attachment

Upload an attachment.  This method uploads an attachment on an object and returns the compact record for the created attachment object. This is possible by either:  - Providing the URL of the external resource being attached, or - Downloading the file content first and then uploading it as any other attachment. Note that it is not possible to attach files from third party services such as Dropbox, Box, Vimeo &amp; Google Drive via the API  The 100MB size limit on attachments in Asana is enforced on this endpoint.  This endpoint expects a multipart/form-data encoded request containing the full contents of the file to be uploaded.  Requests made should follow the HTTP/1.1 specification that line terminators are of the form &#x60;CRLF&#x60; or &#x60;\\r\\n&#x60; outlined [here](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-01#Basic-Rules) in order for the server to reliably and properly handle the request.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
//import com.asana.ApiClient;
//import com.asana.ApiException;
//import com.asana.Configuration;
//import com.asana.auth.*;
//import com.asana.resources.gen.AttachmentsApi;

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");


AttachmentsApi apiInstance = new AttachmentsApi();
String resourceSubtype = "resourceSubtype_example"; // String | 
File file = new File("file_example"); // File | 
String parent = "parent_example"; // String | 
String url = "url_example"; // String | 
String name = "name_example"; // String | 
Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList("optFields_example"); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
try {
    InlineResponse200 result = apiInstance.createAttachmentForObject(resourceSubtype, file, parent, url, name, optPretty, optFields);
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ApiException e) {
    System.err.println("Exception when calling AttachmentsApi#createAttachmentForObject");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
