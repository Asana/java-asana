# **createStory**
> StoryResponse createStory(body, taskGid, optPretty, optFields)

Create a story on a task

Adds a story to a task. This endpoint currently only allows for comment stories to be created. The comment will be authored by the currently authenticated user, and timestamped when the server receives the request.  Returns the full record for the new story added to the task.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
//import com.asana.ApiClient;
//import com.asana.ApiException;
//import com.asana.Configuration;
//import com.asana.auth.*;
//import com.asana.resources.gen.StoriesBase;

ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: oauth2
OAuth oauth2 = (OAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("oauth2");
oauth2.setAccessToken("YOUR ACCESS TOKEN");


StoriesBase apiInstance = new StoriesBase();
StoryBase body = new StoryBase(); // StoryBase | The story to create.
String taskGid = "taskGid_example"; // String | The task to operate on.
Boolean optPretty = true; // Boolean | Provides “pretty” output. Provides the response in a “pretty” format. In the case of JSON this means doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable. This will take extra time and increase the response size so it is advisable only to use this during debugging.
List<String> optFields = Arrays.asList("optFields_example"); // List<String> | Defines fields to return. Some requests return *compact* representations of objects in order to conserve resources and complete the request more efficiently. Other times requests return more information than you may need. This option allows you to list the exact set of fields that the API should be sure to return for the objects. The field names should be provided as paths, described below. The id of included objects will always be returned, regardless of the field options.
try {
    StoryResponse result = apiInstance.createStory(body, taskGid, optPretty, optFields);
    System.out.println(result);
} catch (ApiException e) {
    System.err.println("Exception when calling StoriesBase#createStory");
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
